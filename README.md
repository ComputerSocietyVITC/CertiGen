Generate mass certificates for any event! Simply upload your template certificate (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) and an excel sheet (.xls, .xlsx), choose the font size and upload a custom font(optional) and hit the generate certificates button!

Within minutes (depending on how big your excel sheet is), it will generate all the certificates in "pdf" format and create a zip file which you can download and unzip!

1. Excel sheet should contain only one column (feature) named "Name" under which all the names of the participants should be there.
2. All the names will be written in "Montserrat - ALL BLACK" font.
